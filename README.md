# r-Spawn for Minetest

A spawn command for Minetest without needing a fixed point

If no static spawning point is defined, each player is given a spawn location somewhere near 0,0,0.

If static spawn point is defined, that point is used as origin instead.

Players will not spawn in spaces that are protected by any other player than the Server Admin.

Players can request a new spawn point by typing `/newspawn` if they have the `newspawn` privilege.
